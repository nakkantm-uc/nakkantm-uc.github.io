## Lab 0 - Development Environment Setup

**Overview**: As part of the Lab 0 of Web Application programming and Hacking course , I have setup the Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine using the UC Sandox and installed the recommended software such as apache2 , git , sublime text , pandoc and chrome browser. 
Additionally created git private respository on github, shared it with the instructor and cloned it to the local machine . Moreover , the README.md was edited and Lab0 exercies were performed.
The Labs0 report was written in Markdown format and Pandoc tool was used to genearate the PDF report for submission.

## Part 1 : Ubuntu Virtual Machine and software Installation.
 
Looged on to (https://sandbox02.cech.uc.edu/vcac) and requested access to Web App Programming and Hacking EECE 4005 Virtual Machine. Once the deployment of the VM is done it was accessed through components and connected to the remote console which established the connection to the Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine.

### Apache Web Server Testing

### Private Repository
 
In github.com clicked on the create new repository and named it as waph-nakkantm , made it private and initialized it with a README file. To add 'phung-waph' as a collaborator , I have clicked on the settings icon under the repository . Then clicked on the collaborator and requested phung-waph to add as a collaborator.

To establish SSH authentication , I have generated the SSH key in the local machine and copied the id_rsa.pub public key to GitHub under Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key. Now cloned the repository using the SSH url.
Once the repository is clonned to local , the README.md file is modified as per the template provided by the instructor and added a headshot image . This image was uploaded through github.com directly under images subfolder. All these changes were then staged and commited before pushing to the remote repository . Once the repository is pushed changes were then made on github by modifing the README.md file and these changes were then pulled into the local through terminal.
